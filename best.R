
#The best.R file creates a function called best. The best function takes two arguments: a state name and an outcome name. 
#The outcome name needs to be one of “heart attack”, “heart failure”, or “pneumonia”. 
#The best function reads the outcome-of-care-measures.csv ﬁle and returns the hospital name with the best 
#(i.e. lowest) 30-day mortality rate for a speciﬁed outcome in a specified state.

# Examples:
# best("TX", "heart attack")
# [1] "CYPRESS FAIRBANKS MEDICAL CENTER"
# best("TX", "heart failure")
# [1] "FORT DUNCAN MEDICAL CENTER"

  #If an invalid outcome value is passed to best, the function will throw an error 
  # via the stop function with the exact message invalid outcome.
