
##The rankhospital.R file creates a function called rankhospital that takes three arguments: the 2-character abbreviated name of a state (state), an outcome (outcome), and the ranking of a hospital in that state for that outcome (num). 
#The function reads the outcome-of-care-measures.csv ﬁle and returns a character vector with the name of the hospital that has the ranking speciﬁed by the num argument. 
##The outcome name needs to be one of heart attack, heart failure, or pneumonia

##The num argument can take values best, worst, or an integer indicating the ranking (smaller numbers are better). 
##If the number given by num is larger than the number of hospitals in that state, then the function should return NA. 

## Examples
## source("rankhospital.R")  
## rankhospital("TX", "heart failure", 4)
## [1] "DETAR HOSPITAL NAVARRO"
